Coating
 - Sugar, salt, cinnamon to taste
 - No measurements taken

Other
 - Vegetable oil or Sunflower Seed Oil
    - The amount depends on your pan. Enough oil is needed to "mostly" cover the churros.

**Notes:**
 - More salt and sugar needed
 - Perhaps some baking powder could be added to increase fluffiness
 - Increasing churro diameter made for a better churro
