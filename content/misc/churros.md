Trial 2

Batter

| (Zopf) Flour  | Butter   | Milk    | Sugar   | Egg   | Salt     |
| :-----------: | :------: | :-----: | :-----: | :---: | :------: |
| 400g          | 75g      | 2.5dl   | 45g     | 3     | 2g       |

Coating
 - Sugar, salt, cinnamon to taste
 - No measurements taken

Other
 - Vegetable oil or Sunflower Seed Oil
    - The amount depends on your pan. Enough oil is needed to "mostly" cover the churros.

**Notes:**
 - The baking powder helped, but the fluffiness level still needs improvement.
 - The consistency of the batter was much "stickier". This resulted in a better churro. Try making it yet a little more viscous?

_Best proportions - TBD_

 - Increasing churro diameter made for a better churro
